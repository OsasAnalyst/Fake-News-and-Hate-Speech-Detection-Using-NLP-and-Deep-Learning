# **Fake News & Hate Speech Detection Using NLP and Deep Learning**

## **Executive Summary**  
In today's digital era, social media and online platforms have become major sources of news and communication. However, the rapid spread of **fake news, hate speech, and offensive content** has raised concerns about misinformation and online safety.  

As a **Data Scientist at CyberShield Analytics**, a leading AI-driven cybersecurity firm, I have developed a robust **text classification model** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** to detect **fake news, hate speech, and offensive language** in online content.  

By leveraging **data preprocessing, text vectorization, and LSTM-based neural networks**, this model aims to **enhance content moderation and misinformation detection** across digital platforms. Successfully implementing this project will enable organizations to improve **automated content filtering**, support **human moderators**, and contribute to a **safer, more reliable digital environment**.

## **Data Collection**
This project utilizes a publicly available labeled dataset containing tweets categorized into **hate speech, offensive language, and neutral content**, as well as a **fake news dataset**. The key characteristics of the dataset include:  

- **Source:** Collected from **social media and online news sources**.  
- **Features:** Includes raw text data, class labels, and metadata such as frequency counts of offensive terms.  
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Removal of **punctuation, special characters, and stopwords**.
  - **Lemmatization** to reduce words to their base form.
  - Conversion of text into numerical representations using **word embeddings (One-Hot Encoding, TF-IDF, etc.)**.
  - Balancing data using **SMOTE** to prevent biased classification.

## **Modeling**
The model implemented for this project is a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based neural network**, designed to classify tweets into different categories such as **fake news, hate speech, and offensive language**. The model consists of:  

- An **Embedding Layer** to convert words into dense vector representations  
- **Three LSTM Layers** for sequential text processing and contextual learning  
- A **Dense Layer** with a **softmax activation** function for classification  

The model was compiled using the **Adam optimizer** and trained with **sparse categorical cross-entropy loss** to handle multi-class classification effectively.
